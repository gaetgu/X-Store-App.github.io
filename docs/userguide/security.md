Security is an important matter. As a developer, I'm always trying to avoid security issues and fix them always I can. But, there's always something missing. Some security problem that's not been find yet and can be exploded. That's why users have to care about their accounts and protect them.

In this post, I'll give you some suggestions to protect your account.

### Enable 2FA

2FA is the most secure way to do things. If a hacker has your account and wants to login, you'll be asked if it was you. In this moment, you'll be able to deny permission from the hacker.

### Use strong passwords

Avoid using simple passwords like "John1974" or "1234", instead use strong accounts with a lot of characters like "John-.123,1978".

#### Can't remember these?

If you can't remember your passwords, use a password manager like Lockwise. Also, some browsers like Chrome or Firefox will make the above suggestion easier.

### Don't share your credentials!

Even I won't ask for your credentials.
