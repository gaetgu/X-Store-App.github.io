These are the most asked questions here at XStore. Any questions? [Visit our Discord](https://discord.gg/ByDn5PX)

- *Can I publish Windows only apps to XStore?*

  Yes, you can do that. But users not from that OS won't be able to download it.

- *What targets are available?*
  
  Currently the supported targets are MSIX, MSI, ZIP (outpacked), APK, EXE, APPIMAGE and DEB.

- *What about Apple?*

  We sadly can't support Apple devices because they're too closed. [This could change in the future.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439347/fortnite-epic-apple-preliminary-injunction-opposition-brief#:~:text=Apple%20has%20responded%20to%20Epic's,system%20that%20triggered%20the%20game's)

- *I want to publish a package to XStore. Can I do that?*

  You can't do that now. But it's in the To-Do list.
