Think of it, there are some people creating free repositories for you, they deserve credits.\n\nThis website for example was made by [Marc Esp√≠n](https://github.com/marc2332) and we let the people know that. It's about being ethic. And that's why I want to declare what I'll do and what I won't do.\n\n## Responsibilities\n\n1. I will contribute to Graviton website.\n2. I will ensure security and performance if I can.\n3. I will try to be kind with everyone.\n4. I will force everyone to respect every project's licenses and will make them know they are breaking the law.\n\n## Duties\n\n1. I will not copy the website. I will make something different.\n2. I will not do trash PRs. I will follow every repo's contributing guidelines.\n3. I will not respect others if they are being rude or creating fake news.
