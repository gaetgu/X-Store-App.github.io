When talking about forking other's repos, or using other's packages we all should respect their licenses. Think of it, there are some people creating free repositories for you, they deserve credits.

This website for example was made by [Marc Espín](https://github.com/marc2332) and we let the people know that. It's about being ethic. And that's why I want to declare what I'll do and what I won't do.

## Responsibilities

1. I will contribute to Graviton website.
2. I will ensure security and performance if I can.
3. I will try to be kind with everyone.
4. I will force everyone to respect every project's licenses and will make them know they are breaking the law.

## Duties

1. I will not copy the website. I will make something different.
2. I will not do trash PRs. I will follow every repo's contributing guidelines.
3. I will not respect others if they are being rude or creating fake news. [Donald Trump.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1325099845045071873)
4. I will not break other's licenses.
